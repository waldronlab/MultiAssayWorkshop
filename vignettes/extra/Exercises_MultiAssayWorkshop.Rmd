library(learnr)
library(MultiAssayExperiment)
tutorial_options(exercise.timelimit = 10)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE)
```

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

* use the MultiAssayExperiment constructor function to create the
data representation from individual pieces

## Extractor functions for a MultiAssayExperiment

Before we re-construct our MultiAssayExperiment object (`miniACC`)
we will learn how to deconstruct or take component pieces from the object.
We use extractor functions to "extract" those pieces of the data.

Study the schematic below to see the component pieces of the
`MultiAssayExperiment` data representation.

```{r mae1, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="MultiAssayExperiment object schematic. colData provides data about the patients, cell lines, or other biological units, with one row per unit and one column per variable. The experiments are a list of assay datasets of arbitrary class.  The sampleMap relates each column (observation) in ExperimentList to exactly one row (biological unit) in colData; however, one row of colData may map to zero, one, or more columns per assay, allowing for missing and replicate assays. sampleMap allows for per-assay sample naming conventions. Metadata can be used to store information in arbitrary format about the MultiAssayExperiment. Green stripes indicate a mapping of one subject to multiple observations across experiments.", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/transform-logical.png")
```

## Experiments

Use the `experiments` function to take the experiment data out from
`miniACC`

```{r exp1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
data("miniACC")
miniACC

```

```{r exp1-solution}
data("miniACC")
miniACC

experiments(miniACC)
```

###

Great! Now we can see the list of experiments that were in the
`MultiAssayExperiment` object.
