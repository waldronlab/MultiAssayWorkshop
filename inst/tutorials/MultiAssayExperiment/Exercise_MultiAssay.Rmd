## MultiAssayWorkshop

See the source code of the interactive exercises at
https://github.com/waldronlab/MultiAssayWorkshop

### Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

* extract components of a `MultiAssayExperiment` data structure
* use the `MultiAssayExperiment` constructor function to create the
data representation from individual pieces

### Extractor functions

Before we re-construct our `MultiAssayExperiment` object (`miniACC`)
we will learn how to deconstruct or take component pieces from the object.
We use extractor functions to "extract" those pieces of the data.

Study the schematic below to see the component pieces of the
`MultiAssayExperiment` data representation.

```{r mae1, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/MultiAssayExperiment.png")
```


## *experiments*

### obtaining the list of data experiments

Use the `experiments` function to take the experiment data out from
`miniACC`

```{r exp1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
data("miniACC")
miniACC

```

```{r exp1-solution}
data("miniACC")
miniACC

experiments(miniACC)
```

###

The `experiments` function returns an `ExperimentList` object class that is
part of the `MultiAssayExperiment`. We will see how to get a more general
`List` class shortly.

###

Great! Now we can see the list of experiments that were in the
`MultiAssayExperiment` object.

## *colData*

### phenotypic information

Use the `colData` function to see the phenotype information from `miniACC`

```{r cdat1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
miniACC
```

```{r cdat1-solution}
colData(miniACC)
```

### colData column extraction

Obtain the 'race' variable from the `colData` dataset

```{r cdat2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
miniACC
```

```{r cdat2-solution}
colData(miniACC)$race
colData(miniACC)[["race"]]
# OR
miniACC$race
```

###

## *assays*

### data representation as a 'List'

We can also extract the list of data within the object by using the `assays` function.

```{r assay1}
assays(miniACC)
```

Now use the `class` function on the output of the `assays` function.

```{r assay2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
assays(miniACC)
```

```{r assay2-solution}
class(
    assays(miniACC)
)
```

### SimpleList

The `SimpleList` class is an `S4Vectors` representation of `List`s with metadata.

###

Now we will see how to obtain the sample map information from the `MultiAssayExperiment`

## *sampleMap*

### Graph representation between patients, samples, and assays

In `MultiAssayExperiment` many of the extractor functions have similar or the same naming
convention. For example, to obtain the `sampleMap` from a `MultiAssayExperiment` we use
`sampleMap` extractor function.

```{r smap1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
miniACC
```

```{r smap1-solution}
sampleMap(miniACC)
```

### Test Your Knowledge

```{r expers, echo = FALSE}
question(" What function do you use to extract the experiments from miniACC?",
    answer("Experiments", message = "Remember, R is case sensitive!"),
    answer("experiments", correct = TRUE),
    answer("ExperimentList", message = "Close! This is the name of the class that houses the data."),
    allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Common mistakes

Keeping track of all the names can be a challenge. It is common to confuse
constructors with extractor functions. For example, using `ExperimentList`
instead of `experiments` to attempt to obtain the experiment data. The software
will give you a helpful error message when this is occurs.

###

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ExperimentList(miniACC)
```

## The constructor

### MultiAssayExperiment

The constructor function has three main arguments all corresponding to the
component pieces.

* `experiments`
* `colData`
* `sampleMap`

Now that we know how to obtain these from an existing `MultiAssayExperiment`,
create one function call using the constructor and the set of extractors we
learned above.

```{r const1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
experiments(miniACC)
colData(miniACC)
sampleMap(miniACC)
```

**Hint:** See `?MultiAssayExperiment` for more details.

```{r const1-solution}
MultiAssayExperiment(
    experiments = experiments(miniACC),
    colData = colData(miniACC),
    sampleMap = sampleMap(miniACC)
)
```

###

Awesome! We have our first `MultiAssayExperiment`!
